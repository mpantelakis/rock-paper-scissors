# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This project focuses on applying the knowledge acquired from the **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript Foundations** courses of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to create a simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game with an interactive UI.

Through this project, I mainly learned how to **manipulate the DOM** and how to **use JavaScript events** effectively to create interactive elements on a webpage.

You can view and play the live version of the project here: [Rock-Paper-Scissors Live Demo](https://mpantelakis.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)
